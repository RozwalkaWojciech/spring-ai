## OPEN AI

1. If you want to run these codes you need to set up your OpenAI API key to environment variables first.

```bash
export OPEN_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

2. Then you can run the demo with Maven.

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

3. REST API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`
